# Data Engineering
>Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files.
>Remember to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
For the primary keys, verify that the column is unique. Otherwise, create a composite key Links to an external site., which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row.
Be sure to create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.
>Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.
